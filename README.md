# Insteon

Insteon modem adapter for Elixir.  Allows parsing of all Insteon
messages and controlling Insteon devices.

## Work In Progress

This is currently a work in progress.  It can parse all Insteon messages,
but it currently does not control Insteon devices.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `insteon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:insteon, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```
